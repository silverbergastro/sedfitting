Extremely HPM known M Dwarf with low W4 IRxs but excellent W3 IRxs and W3 images. We simply cannot let this one get away from us without looking at it. Hugo: I agree, high chances to find something interesting in this one compared with other selections
followup justification:
HPM M Dwarf with I-IR-E and fails ruler test, but has excellent W3 excess to substitute.

Insufficient IRxs for this HPM M star, but easily passes Ruler Test. HPM Mdwarfc with Debris Diskc. VSX (-). Extension essentially normal and thin.
followup justification:
I-IR-E passes Ruler Test easily, so good IRxs.
